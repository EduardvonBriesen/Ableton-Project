[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

This is a small collection of Abelton projects, resulting from me trying to produce music. 
I mainly use this repository for versioning and backup.
You can have listen in the [tracks](https://github.com/EduardvonBriesen/Ableton-Project/tree/main/Tracks) folder or on my [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/eduard-von-briesen).
